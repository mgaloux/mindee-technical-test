Mindee Technical Interview

### Installation 

```
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

### Goals attained
- Using React Mindee Js package API to retrieve Financial Document Information
- Display This information in an efficient way, at least `line_items`, `total_amount`, `due_date`, `document_type`, `orientation`	and `locale` fields. [BONUS] Integrated every single output.
- [BONUS] Added confidence indicator integrating MUI Charts
- [BONUS] Added overview paragraph to resume important information in a human-readable way.

### Test Report

- Integrating Mindee API was quick and easy, and I tried to come up with a few ideas to make the user experience better. In a matter of hours, I think I fulfilled the goal of the test. Here are some bonuses I would add if I had more time

-> PDF Support 
-> Turn all fields into inputs, when we click on a field, we have an interface to select another detected text from the image, to rectify stuff
-> Of course, quality insurance stuff like tests, factorizing, internationalization, accessibility, responsiveness.
